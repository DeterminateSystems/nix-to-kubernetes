# Nix to Kubernetes

This repo provides an example of integrating [Nix] into a [DevOps] deployment
pipeline. The scenario:

* [Terraform] stands up a [Kubernetes] cluster on [DigitalOcean][do]
* [Nix] provides a development environment for a simple&mdash;okay,
  silly&mdash;[Go] web service that tells you your horoscope based on your star
  sign.
* Nix also builds a [Docker] image for the web service.
* A [GitHub Actions][actions] pipeline builds and then deploys the image to a
  [Kubernetes] cluster running on [DigitalOcean][do].

This repo was created in conjunction with [Deploying Nix-built containers to
Kubernetes][post], which is published on our [blog].

## Moving parts

* [Go web service](./cmd/horoscope)
* [Terraform config](./main.tf)
* [Terraform variable definitions](./variables.tf) and [variable
  values](./terraform.tfvars)
* [Kubernetes Deployment config](./kubernetes/deployment.yaml)
* A [Nix flake](./flake.nix) defines the development environment and package/app
  outputs
* [Nix-defined continous integration logic](./flake.nix#L71-L90)
* [GitHub Actions pipeline](./.github/workflows/ci.yml). **Note**: the
  [`deploy`][deploy] job in the Actions pipeline is expected to fail, as it
  assumes that the Kubernetes cluster is currently running. We're gonna go ahead
  and save costs (and electricity) by `terraform destroy`ing the cluster when
  we're not using it ðŸ˜€

The GitHub Actions pipeline includes Nix [remote caching][cache] provided by
[Cachix]. [GitHub Container Registry][ghcr] stores [Docker] images built by Nix.

## Developing this scenario

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for instructions on standing up the
infrastructure and interacting with the Kubernetes cluster.
